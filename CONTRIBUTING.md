## Contribute code

If you want to contribute code to TS-Fuse, you can do so by:

### 1. Forking the repository

You can fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own account where you can make changes. You can read more about forking a repository [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

### 2. Implementing the feature or fixing the bug

You can now implement the feature or fix the bug in your forked repository. When you are done, you can continue to the next step.

### 3. Creating a pull request

You can create a pull request by clicking the "Contribute" then "Open pull request" in the top right corner of the forked repository page. This will create a pull request where you can describe what you have done. You can read more about creating a pull request [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

There will already be a template for the pull request. If you have no issue created for the bug or feature you are working on, you can remove the "Related Issue" section. Otherwise, please make sure to include the issue number in the "Related Issue" section.

### 4. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed

When you have created the pull request, it will be reviewed. There can be some things that need to be changed before the pull request can be merged. If this is the case, you will be notified in the pull request. When the pull request is ready to be merged, it will be merged and your changes will be included in the next release of TS-Fuse!

### 5. Celebrate!

Congratulations! You have now contributed to TS-Fuse! ðŸŽ‰
